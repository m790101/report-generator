## Overview

The Report Generator is a tool designed to streamline the process of compiling health check reports from multiple days into a single, cohesive document. This makes it easy to track and compare outcomes over time, eliminating the need to manually review and send multiple individual reports.

## Purpose

This tool was created to solve a common **challenge**: my girlfriend found it difficult to present treatment outcomes effectively by sending clients multiple reports from different days. The Report Generator simplifies this by combining all relevant data into one clear, comprehensive report.
